# Identifiers
    - All variables, class, object, functions, list, tupple, dictionaries, in python together are termed as python identifiers.


    Rules for using python identifiers.
    1. an idenrtifiers name can begin with letters or an underscore(_)
        eg. _myName, My_name
    2. We cannot use number at the starting of the identifier but we can use number in between the name
        eg. ab1, AB1, ab1b, 
    3. Special charachters are not allowed. Except underscore(_)
        e.g my-name is not allowed but my_name is allowed.
    4. Identifiers are case sensitive
        e.g a = 50 and A = 60 are diff
    5. We can not use keywords as an identifiers.
        keywords: The words which are predefined and have certain meaning in python.
        There are total 35(36 in new version) keywords.
